@*Gnuplot. This is a simple Lisp wrapper for gnuplot.

@ We begin with a package definition. Only the tests require |rt|.

@ This little utility function is primarily used to resolve list designators.

@ Gnuplot commands will be designated by Lisp objects, which we'll convert
to strings using the Lisp pretty printer with a specialized dispatch table.
The goal is to offer a transparent, Lispy interface instead of raw (string)
commands, but not to go much further than that.

@l
(defparameter *gnuplot-pprint-dispatch* (copy-pprint-dispatch nil))

@ Strings designate themselves in commands.

@l
(set-gnuplot-dispatch 'string

@ Symbols designate their name in lowercase.

@l
(set-gnuplot-dispatch 'symbol
  (lambda (stream object)
    (write-string (string-downcase (symbol-name object)) stream)))

@ We'll treat most lists as standing for commands with whitespace-separated
constituents. E.g., using the symbol dispatching we just defined, in a
|gnuplot| block you can say |(set key off)| instead of the equivalent
|"set key off"|.

@l

@ We'll write pathnames using gnuplot's single-quote syntax, which requires
that embedded single-quote characters be escaped by doubling them.

@ We'll execute gnuplot using SBCL's |run-program|. We treat symbols
as designators for the same-named command-line options; keyword symbols
designate GNU-style long options (e.g., \.{--persist}), and all other
symbols designate X11-style options (e.g., \.{-clear}).

@ Here's the primary interface function. It takes a list of command-line
options followed by any number of command designators. Lists whose first
element is |string=| to |:plot| or |:splot| are treated specially; we'll
get to the specifics in a moment. All other command deisgnators are
mechanically translated to gnuplot syntax via pretty-printing.

Even though this is a function, I usually indent it like it's a macro whose
|cddr| is a body. You can tell GNU~Emacs to do this automatically like so:
|(put 'gnuplot 'lisp-indent-function 1)|.

@ Gnuplot's two primary plotting commands commands, \.{plot} and~\.{splot},
get special treatment. With the exception of a form beginning with the key
|:ranges|, for which we offer a bit of extra support---|(:ranges x y)| gets
translated to \.{"[x] [y]"} and inserted near the beginning of the
command---each subform, or {\it clause}, is treated as a specification for
a plot. When all of the clauses have been analyzed, they are spliced
together with commas to form the complete command.

We do not attempt a detailed analysis of the clauses, as that would require
far too much knowledge of the (fairly intricate) syntax of the plot command.
What we do offer, though, is support for {\it inline data sources}. The idea
here is that you have (say) a Lisp sequence full of data which you'd like to
plot; rather than writing it out to a file and having gnuplot read it back
in, we can replace the data source in the command specification with the
special filename \.{'-'}, which tells gnuplot to read the data from its
standard input. We then return all of the inline data sources along with
the reconstructed command.

off doing it in Lisp. We support only constant-width bins for now.

@ We represent histograms as two-dimensional arrays, with a row for each bin.

@<Make a histogram array@>=

@ The first column contains the coordinates of the left-hand bin edges.

@<Fill the first histogram column@>=
(loop for bin below bins
